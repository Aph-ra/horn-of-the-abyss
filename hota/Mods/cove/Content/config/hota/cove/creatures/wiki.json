They can be found in virtually every corner of the world, though, more often, they rob the coast and sea trade routes. Skilled pirates who deserved respect among Regnan captains called Corsairs. Their skill in fencing allows them to make lightning attacks on enemies who are not able to fight back. Sea Dogs are legendary Corsairs who robbed dozens of ships. Rumored that they keep their prey on the lost islands, which many in the Endless Ocean. Sea Dogs armed with perfect pistols that created by the best alchemists of Regna. Perhaps that is why these fighters shots so deadly.\r\n\r\n{gold|Special Ability : Ranged attack. No melee penalty. No enemy retaliation. Accurate shot.}\r\nThe Sea Dog's {Accurate Shot} is triggered after a shot: each creature in an attacking stack has a X% chance of killing a creature in the attacked squad, but the total number of killed creatures cannot be more than (number of creatures in an attacking squad) * X/100 (rounded up). X = 3 multiplier for shooting without penalty and X = 2 if shooting with penalty. Ability doesn't work if shooting at creatures behind walls.\r\nLike with Mighty Gorgons, care should be taken to maximize Accurate Shot caps when splitting stacks of Sea Dogs. The cap is the real limiting factor: 33 Sea Dogs will never kill more than one creature with their ability, while 34 of them can kill two when shooting without penalty, 27% of the time. Likewise, 67 Sea Dogs is the minimum amount for a triple kill, but the chance of it already starts at 33%. Accurate Shots can be used as a ranged and {red|improved} version of Death Stare with ability to {gold|snipe} undead and non-living creatures down at the cost of lower efficiency per growth ratio.\r\rRanged attack is a special ability of creatures, which allows them to attack without engaging into hand-to-hand combat. When attacking in melee, most ranged creatures suffer melee penalty, which halves their damage unless they have no melee penalty ability. Ranged penalty halves the ranged damage farther away than 10 hexes.\r\n\r\nSea Dogs are without question the best tier 3 creature in the game. They have great stats and a ranged version of the Mighty Gorgon's death stare ability. This is balanced by the high cost of the Gunpowder Warehouse, which prevents them from being acquired too early in the game. Pirates and Corsairs should generally be upgraded to Sea Dogs before engaging enemy players.\r\nSea Dogs are in fact very expensive (Unit price is 375g), combined with their regular T3 weekly growth rate, total cost rivals tier 6 creatures. It's not wise to use them in early games, as they are not cost effective."

Make sure that the attack will actually kill at least one unit, so Ferocity can trigger -- this is another reason to attack a wounded stack. In a pinch, using a damage spell before the attack can also help. In longer games, larger stacks mean Ferocity will always trigger.\r\nAbove all else, don't let the opponent gang up on Ayssids, as Ferocity doesn't work when retaliating. Fly away when surrounded and attack another weakened stack at the end of the next turn."
