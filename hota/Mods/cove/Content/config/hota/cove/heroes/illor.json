This obsession with a high position in the society led him to studying sky creatures eventually. After lengthy roaming across seas, he understood his lousiness as a pirate. The crew doesn't respect him, and the prey always escapes. Lonely and abandoned, he descended upon an island where giant birds were nesting. Illor spent some time on the island, taming the birds to his command.",
