	"map.[hota] a new day tomorrow.event.1.description" : "战争，可以说是一个国家最具破坏性的灾难。上议院倾向于寻求最微小的理由来实现它。他们想要增强自己的力量，获得更多的土地，恢复他们的尊严，或者只是为了排解无聊。你是那种渴望权力的人，但很快就被赶出去了，这被证明是一个幸运的事情。风暴之中，你安置在这里的一个老朋友希望你有一个新的开始。战争，就是你的新家园。战争从来没有停止过，在君主死后变得越发残酷。风暴从来没有停止。你有幸得到一个良好的开端安静下来，没有任何人打扰你，这都要感谢你的朋友。向各个方向派遣侦察员是明智的，因为给不满的土地制造几个污浊的惊喜在准备工作中是至关重要的。",
